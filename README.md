#Calculator APP

This is an Odin Project that lets me end up with a working calculator that can be used in a web browser. I should be able to type numbers and calculate simple functions such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc. 



##First Git Commit
1. added simple boilerplate to html and CSS

##Second Git Commit
1. Fixed error(refer to defer for script) in the index page.
2. added to the script file

I needed to come up with an idea on how I need to go about this program. 
    First, I need the buttons to add a either a number or a function to the display. 
    If a function is clicked, I need it to grab the previous number added and a new number and calculate the value.
    I will make the display essentially the variable holder for the values to be inputted (display will show 5 then I can click add, it will then clear the display and allow to input another number, like say 6 and then I can press enter or the equal button and show the result on the display, which in this case would be 11)
Sounds simple enough, yeah?

For this push, I am laying down SUPER SUPER SUPER base level stuff. I have each button doing a VERY simple addition to the display.
Nothing happens with the negative/positive button right now, and there's still a decent amount of work to do with making it completely functional.
